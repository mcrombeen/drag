- [ ] allow for multiple selection
- [      it is possible to select multiple images in the file picker dialog. To enable this, you would need to add the multiple attribute to the input element with type "file" in your HTML. This attribute allows users to select more than one file at a time when the file picker dialog opens.
When the 'change' event is triggered for the 'image-picker' input element, you can then access the multiple files selected by the user through the event.target.files property, which is a FileList object. You can iterate through the FileList and call the 'loadImage' function for each file, allowing the script to load and display all selected images on the canvas.
